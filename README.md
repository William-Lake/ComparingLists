# ComparingLists
A small python utility program I wrote for the rare instances where I just need to compare two lists of data.

Compiled to an .exe thanks to [Brent Vollebregt](https://github.com/brentvollebregt)'s awesome [auto-py-to-exe](https://github.com/brentvollebregt/auto-py-to-exe) project. Thanks Brent!
