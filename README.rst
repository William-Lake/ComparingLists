A small python utility program I wrote for the rare instances where I just need to compare two lists of data.


* Free software: MIT license
* Documentation: https://comparing-lists.readthedocs.io.

Usage
--------

#. Run the program
  - If using the .exe, double click it.
  - If using the ComparingLists.py open a terminal and run:

  .. code:: bash

        python ComparingLists.py
  
#. Provide the name of the first list:

.. image:: images/List_Name_1.gif

#. Provide the first list delimiter:

.. image:: images/List_Delim_1.gif

#. Provide first list data:

.. image:: images/List_Data_1.gif

#. Provide the name of the second list:

.. image:: images/List_Name_2.gif

#. Provide the second list delimiter:

.. image:: images/List_Delim_2.gif

#. Provide second list data:

.. image:: images/List_Data_2.gif

#. Review results and determine if you'd like to go again (Anything that doesn't start with a 'y' is taken as a No.):
